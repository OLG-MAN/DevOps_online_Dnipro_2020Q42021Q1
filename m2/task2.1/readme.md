* Virtual SMP: Enables a single VM to use multiple physical processors at a time.
* vMotion: Enables live migration with transaction integrity.
* Storage vMotion: Enables VM file migration from one place to other without service interruption.
* High Availability: If one server fails, VM is shifted to another server with spare capacity to enable business continuity.
* Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS): Assigns and balances compute automatically across hardware resources available for VMs.
* Fault Tolerance: Generates copy of primary VM to ensure its continuous availability.
* Distributed Switch (VDS): Spans multiple ESXi hosts and enables considerable reduction of network maintenance activities and increases network capacity.
* Network & Storage I/O Control.
* Hot add CPU and RAM resources.
